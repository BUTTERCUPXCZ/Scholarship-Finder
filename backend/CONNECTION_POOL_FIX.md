# Database Connection Pool Fix Guide

## Problem
Your application is experiencing Prisma connection pool timeouts with error code P2024. This happens when:
- The connection pool limit (default: 10) is exhausted
- Database operations are taking too long
- Connections are not being properly released

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Connection Pool Settings
The database configuration now includes:
- **Connection limit**: Increased from 10 to 50
- **Pool timeout**: Set to 30 seconds
- **Connect timeout**: Set to 30 seconds  
- **Socket timeout**: Set to 30 seconds

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added specific handling for P2024 (connection pool timeout) errors
- Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- Better logging for connection pool issues

### 3. Connection Monitoring
- Added ConnectionMonitor to track database metrics
- Real-time monitoring of active queries and timeouts
- Periodic health checks and logging

## Environment Variables

Make sure your DATABASE_URL is properly configured. If you need to manually add connection pool parameters, use this format:

```bash
# PostgreSQL example
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?connection_limit=50&pool_timeout=30&connect_timeout=30&socket_timeout=30"

# For connection pooling services like PgBouncer, use these additional parameters:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?connection_limit=50&pool_timeout=30&connect_timeout=30&socket_timeout=30&pgbouncer=true&prepared_statements=false"
```

## Monitoring

The application now logs connection metrics every minute. Look for:
- Active queries count
- Connection pool timeouts
- Average queries per minute

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your backend server** to apply the new connection pool settings
2. **Monitor the logs** for connection metrics and any remaining timeout errors
3. **Consider using a connection pooler** like PgBouncer for production environments
4. **Review your database queries** for potential optimizations if timeouts persist

## Production Recommendations

For production environments, consider:
- Using a connection pooler (PgBouncer, pgpool-II)
- Setting up read replicas for read-heavy operations
- Implementing database query caching
- Using database connection limits appropriate for your instance size

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience timeouts after implementing these changes:
1. Check your database server CPU and memory usage
2. Review slow query logs
3. Consider increasing your database instance size
4. Implement query optimizations or indexing
